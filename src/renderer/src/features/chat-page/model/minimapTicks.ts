 * Positions are fractions of the total scrolled height, which makes the map independent of the
 * viewport size and of the zoom level; widths are fractions of the longest message, so the widest
 * mark is the longest message in the conversation and the rest scale against it.
 *
 * The length ratio is compressed with a square root before it becomes a width. Raw ratios are far
 * too skewed to draw: a real session measured 55 to 7837 characters between messages, i.e. 140:1,
 * which left every question at the 2 px floor and only the longest answer visible. Compressing keeps
 * the ordering and keeps the longest message at full width, while the short ones stay readable
 * (that same session draws 3 px to 40 px instead of 2 px to 40 px).
 *
 * Without usable geometry there is nothing to draw, so an empty list is returned rather than marks
 * invented from estimates that do not match the layout yet.
